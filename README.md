From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

This was my first html/css project as part of the odin project curriculum (as seen in the above link).

This took me around 2 days to complete working on and off and helped introduce me to using html, css & brower developer tools.
